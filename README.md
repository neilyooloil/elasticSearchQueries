elasticSearchQueries
====================

A library of valid JSON ElasticSearch Queries and Filters

This repository is meant to provide working elasticsearch examples that represent complete "body" objects that can be 
used against the search API. 
A common hurdle I have heard from many folks in examining the Elasticsearch documentation has been that only snippets of queries are included.
These examples aid to provide a fuller set of documentation. Pull requests welcome!
